# Little Pont

This project was designed for Milestone Project 4 of Code Institutes' Level 5 Diploma in Web Development.

Little Pont is fantastic new business that is about to launch in the village of Ponteland, Northumberland. 
A lack in services for young children and families in the village of Ponteland, led a group of enthusiastic mothers (all with early years and/or teaching experience) to get together and start this exciting new venture. 

Little Pont is primarily a role play village that has been modelled upon the actual village of Ponteland where children can let their imagination run wild. Children enjoy imaginary play.... This new business also a combines Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) learning created specifically for early years children. Each Class has an exciting STEM learning activity taught by one of our fantastic team. Classes are booked based upon the age of the child but siblings are welcome to come along and get involved. The business is family-orientated and its ethos is to provide a safe, fun and educational place for children and families to come together within their community to learn, play and socialise together. 

The Little Pont team are looking to launch their business with the aid of a brand new website. Ponteland and its surrounding areas are highly affluent, and they want the website to appeal to this local community. The website must be easy to access and simple to use. It needs to look professional and aesthetic but also fun and playful. 

This website has been built using HTML, CSS, Javascript and Python.

## Deployment

-   ### Version Control

To deploy Take A Hike to Heroku, take the following steps:
1. Create a requirements.txt file using the terminal command `pip freeze > requirements.txt`
2. Create a Procfile with the terminal command `echo web: python app.py > Procfile`. Ensure you use a capital 'P' for this file.
3. `git add` and `git commit` these changes and `git push` to GitHub repository
4. Go to the Heroku website and login. Create a new app by clicking the "New" button in your dashboard.
5. Give the app and name and set the region to Europe(or your closest region)
6. From the heroku dashboard of the new app, click on "Deploy" > "Deployment method" and select Github
7. Confirm the link to the correct GitHub repository
8. In the heroku dashboard for the application. click on the "settings" > "Reveal Config Vars"
9. Set the following Config Vars:

|   | Key            | Value          |   |
|---|----------------|----------------|---|
|   | DB_URL         |     |   |
|   | IP             |       |   |
|   | PORT           |            |   |
|   | SECRET_KEY     |    |   |

(this is an example, actual env variable not disclosed to maintain security. To get the db url follow [CI PosgreSQL]())

10. In the Heroku dashboard, click "Deploy"
11. In the "Manual Deployment" section, ensure the master branch is selected then click "Deploy Branch"
11. The site is now deployed
12. To connect to the database click the more button on the Heroku dashboard and select run console.
13. Type python3 and once the interpreter opens, run the following:
```bash
from ... import db
db.create_all()
exit()
```
